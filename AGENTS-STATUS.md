## 📋 How Agents Are Active

The agents are integrated into configuration files that AI assistants read automatically:

1. **`.cursorrules.txt`** - Cursor IDE reads this automatically
2. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Claude Code reads this automatically

This means:
- ✅ Agents work automatically on every interaction
- ✅ No need to invoke agents manually
- ✅ Agents provide background support continuously
- ✅ All three agents work together simultaneously

## 🔄 What This Means

### For You (Developer)
- Agents are always helping in the background
- You get automatic library recommendations
- You get automatic code quality reviews
- You get automatic beginner-friendly explanations
- No manual setup required - it just works!

### For AI Assistants (Claude, etc.)
When working on AutoDrafter codebase, AI assistants automatically:
1. **Library Research Agent:** Search for libraries before coding
2. **Learning Agent:** Explain concepts clearly
3. **Code Quality Agent:** Review code for issues
4. **API Endpoint Monitor Agent:** Monitor endpoints and detect errors
5. **Debugging Agent:** Help debug errors and analyze issues
6. **Code Validation Agent:** Validate code changes work correctly, run tests automatically
7. **Auto-Debugging Escalation Agent:** Escalate debugging efforts when fixes fail, search external sources systematically

## ✅ Verification

To verify agents are active:
1. Ask AI assistant to implement a feature
2. It should AUTOMATICALLY search for libraries first (Library Research Agent)
3. It should AUTOMATICALLY explain concepts clearly (Learning Agent)
4. It should AUTOMATICALLY review code quality (Code Quality Agent)

**All three agents work together automatically - no manual activation needed!**
